* There is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.
* Writes are replayed to the read replicas.  If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.
* The more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.
* On some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.
* Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.
