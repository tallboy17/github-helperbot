Feel free to send a pull request to add more strings, or additional sections. However, please do not send pull requests with very-long strings (255+ characters), as that makes the list much more difficult to view.  
Likewise, please do not send pull requests which compromise *manual usability of the file*. This includes the [EICAR test string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file), which can cause the file to be flagged by antivirus scanners, and files which alter the encoding of `blns.txt`. Also, do not send a null character (U+0000) string, as it [changes the file format on GitHub to binary](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19723302) and renders it unreadable in pull requests. Finally, when adding or removing a string please update all files when you perform a pull request.
