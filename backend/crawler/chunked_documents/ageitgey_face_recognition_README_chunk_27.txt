If you want to create a standalone executable that can run without the need to install `python` or `face_recognition`, you can use [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller). However, it requires some custom configuration to work with this library. See [this issue](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/357) for how to do it.
