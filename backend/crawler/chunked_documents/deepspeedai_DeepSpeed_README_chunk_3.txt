***[DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) enabled the world's most powerful language models (at the time of this writing) such as [MT-530B](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/) and [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed)***. It is an easy-to-use deep learning optimization software suite that powers unprecedented scale and speed for both training and inference. With DeepSpeed you can:  
* Train/Inference dense or sparse models with billions or trillions of parameters
* Achieve excellent system throughput and efficiently scale to thousands of GPUs
* Train/Inference on resource constrained GPU systems
* Achieve unprecedented low latency and high throughput for inference
* Achieve extreme compression for an unparalleled inference latency and model size reduction with low costs
