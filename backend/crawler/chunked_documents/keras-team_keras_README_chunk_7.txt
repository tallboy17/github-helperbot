-----
- Run your high-level Keras workflows on top of any framework -- benefiting at will from the advantages of each framework,
e.g. the scalability and performance of JAX or the production ecosystem options of TensorFlow.
- Write custom components (e.g. layers, models, metrics) that you can use in low-level workflows in any framework.
- You can take a Keras model and train it in a training loop written from scratch in native TF, JAX, or PyTorch.
- You can take a Keras model and use it as part of a PyTorch-native `Module` or as part of a JAX-native model function.
- Make your ML code future-proof by avoiding framework lock-in.
- As a PyTorch user: get access to power and usability of Keras, at last!
- As a JAX user: get access to a fully-featured, battle-tested, well-documented modeling and training library.
