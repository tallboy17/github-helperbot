Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with
the world's simplest face recognition library.  
Built using [dlib](http://dlib.net/)'s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
[Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) benchmark.  
This also provides a simple `face_recognition` command line tool that lets
you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!
