- This page is not meant to be comprehensive. I am trying to keep it light and not too overwhelming.
- The selection of articles is opinionated.
- I don't necessarily agree with or endorse every single line that is written in every single one of those resources. The same applies to their authors: I don't endorse everything each of those authors has said and will ever say.
