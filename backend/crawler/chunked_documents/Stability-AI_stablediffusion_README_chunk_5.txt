Stable Diffusion models are general text-to-image diffusion models and therefore mirror biases and (mis-)conceptions that are present
in their training data. Although efforts were made to reduce the inclusion of explicit pornographic material, **we do not recommend using the provided weights for services or products without additional safety mechanisms and considerations.
The weights are research artifacts and should be treated as such.**
Details on the training procedure and data, as well as the intended use of the model can be found in the corresponding [model card](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2).
The weights are available via [the StabilityAI organization at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/StabilityAI) under the [CreativeML Open RAIL++-M License](LICENSE-MODEL).
