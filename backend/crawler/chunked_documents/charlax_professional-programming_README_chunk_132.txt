- [The Great Confusion About URIs](https://benbernardblog.com/the-great-confusion-about-uris/)
- A URI is a string of characters that identifies a resource. Its syntax is `<scheme>:<authority><path>?<query>#<fragment>`, where only `<scheme>` and `<path>` are mandatory. URL and URN are URIs.
- A URL is a string of characters that identifies a resource located on a computer network. Its syntax depends on its scheme. E.g. `mailto:billg@microsoft.com`.
- A URN is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a resource. Its syntax is `urn:<namespace identifier>:<namespace specific string>`. E.g. `urn:isbn:9780062301239`
