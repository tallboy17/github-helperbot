- [Why you should use links, not keys, to represent relationships in APIs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/api-design-why-you-should-use-links-not-keys-to-represent-relationships-in-apis), Martin Nally, Google
- "Using links instead of foreign keys to express relationships in APIs reduces the amount of information a client needs to know to use an API, and reduces the ways in which clients and servers are coupled to each other."
- [Give me /events, not webhooks](https://blog.sequin.io/events-not-webhooks/)
- Events can unlock much-needed webhook features, like allowing your webhook consumers to replay or reset the position of their webhook subscription.
