Unified access to the best community driven cheat sheets repositories of the world.  
Let's imagine for a moment that there is such a thing as an ideal cheat sheet.
What should it look like?
What features should it have?  
* **Concise** — It should only contain the things you need, and nothing else.
* **Fast** — It should be possible to use it instantly.
* **Comprehensive** — It should contain answers for every possible question.
* **Universal** — It should be available everywhere, anytime, without any preparations.
* **Unobtrusive** — It should not distract you from your main task.
* **Tutoring** — It should help you to learn the subject.
* **Inconspicuous** — It should be possible to use it completely unnoticed.  
Such a thing exists! It's easy to [install](#installation) and there's even [auto-complete](#tab-completion).
