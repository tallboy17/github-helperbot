- A great example of a [postmortem from Gitlab (01/31/2017)](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) for an outage during which an engineer's action caused the irremediable loss of 6 hours of data.

- [A list of postmortems on Github](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems)
- Google's SRE book, [Postmortem chapter](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/postmortem-culture/) is excellent and includes many examples.

- High reliability organisations — which have less than their fair share of accidents — recognise that human variability is a force to harness in averting errors, but they work hard to focus that variability and are constantly preoccupied with the possibility of failure
