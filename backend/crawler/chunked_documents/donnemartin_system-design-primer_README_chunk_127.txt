* Each cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay.
* Data can become stale if it is updated in the database.  This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.
* When a node fails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency.
