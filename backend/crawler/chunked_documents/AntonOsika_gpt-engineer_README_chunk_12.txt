By default, gpt-engineer supports OpenAI Models via the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI API, as well as Anthropic models.  
With a little extra setup, you can also run with open source models like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.
