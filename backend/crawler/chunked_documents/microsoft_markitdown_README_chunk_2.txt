Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still
provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as
OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively "_speak_" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their
responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of
Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions
are also highly token-efficient.
