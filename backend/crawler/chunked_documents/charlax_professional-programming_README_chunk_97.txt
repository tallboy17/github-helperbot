I would recommend learning:  
- JavaScript and maybe another interpreted language (Python, Ruby, etc.). Interpreted languages are useful for quick one-off automation scripts, and fastest to write for interviews. JavaScript is ubiquitous.
- A compiled language (Java, C, C++...).
- [Learn c in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)
- A more recent language to see where the industry is going (as of writing, Go, Swift, Rust, Elixir...).
- A language that has first-class support for functional programming (Haskell, Scala, Clojure...).

- These new perspectives, these ideas and patterns â€” they linger, they stay with you, even if you end up in another language. And that is powerful enough to keep on learning new languages, because one of the best things that can happen to you when youâ€™re trying to solve a problem is a change of perspective.
