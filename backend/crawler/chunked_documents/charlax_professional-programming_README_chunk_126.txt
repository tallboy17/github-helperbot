- ‚≠êÔ∏è [Testing strategies in a microservices architecture](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) (Martin Fowler) is an awesome resources explaining how to test a service properly.

Why test:  
- [Why bother writing tests at all?](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/14/why-bother-writing-tests-at-all), Dave Cheney. A good intro to the topic.
- Even if you don‚Äôt, someone will test your software
- The majority of testing should be performed by development teams
- Manual testing should not be the majority of your testing because manual testing is O(n)
- Tests are the critical component that ensure you can always ship your master branch
- Tests lock in behaviour
- Tests give you confidence to change someone else‚Äôs code  
How to test:  
- [A quick puzzle to test your problem solving](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html?_r=0)... and a great way to learn about confirmation bias and why you're mostly writing positive test cases.
- [Testing is not for beginners](https://www.calhoun.io/testing-is-not-for-beginners/): why learning to test is hard. This shouldn't demotivate you though!

- Be clear about the different types of tests that you want to write. Agree on the naming in your team and find consensus on the scope of each type of test.
- Every single test in your test suite is additional baggage and doesn't come for free.
- Test code is as important as production code.
