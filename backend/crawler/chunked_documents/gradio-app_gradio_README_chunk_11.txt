You can also build Gradio applications without writing any code. Simply type `gradio sketch` into your terminal to open up an editor that lets you define and modify Gradio components, adjust their layouts, add events, all through a web editor. Or [use this hosted version of Gradio Sketch, running on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/aliabid94/Sketch).
