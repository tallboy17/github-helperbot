Ultralytics provides two licensing options to meet different needs:  
- **AGPL-3.0 License**: An [OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) open-source license ideal for academic research, personal projects, and testing. It promotes open collaboration and knowledge sharing. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/LICENSE) file for details.
- **Enterprise License**: Tailored for commercial applications, this license allows seamless integration of Ultralytics software and AI models into commercial products and services, bypassing the open-source requirements of AGPL-3.0.
