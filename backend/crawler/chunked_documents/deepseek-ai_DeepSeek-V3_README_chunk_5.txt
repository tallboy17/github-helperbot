> [!NOTE]
> The total size of DeepSeek-V3 models on Hugging Face is 685B, which includes 671B of the Main Model weights and 14B of the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Module weights.  
To ensure optimal performance and flexibility, we have partnered with open-source communities and hardware vendors to provide multiple ways to run the model locally. For step-by-step guidance, check out Section 6: [How_to Run_Locally](#6-how-to-run-locally).  
For developers looking to dive deeper, we recommend exploring [README_WEIGHTS.md](./README_WEIGHTS.md) for details on the Main Model weights and the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Modules. Please note that MTP support is currently under active development within the community, and we welcome your contributions and feedback.
