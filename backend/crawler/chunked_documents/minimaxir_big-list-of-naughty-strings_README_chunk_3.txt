`blns.txt` consists of newline-delimited strings and comments which are preceded with `#`. The comments divide the strings into sections for easy manual reading and copy/pasting into input forms. For those who want to access the strings programmatically, a `blns.json` file is provided containing an array with all the comments stripped out (the `scripts` folder contains a Python script used to generate the `blns.json`).
