**If `install.sh` runs successfully, you may skip No.1,2,3**  
**Users in China can [download all these models here](https://www.yuque.com/baicaigongchang1145haoyuangong/ib3g1e/dkxgpiy9zb96hob4#nVNhX).**  
1. Download pretrained models from [GPT-SoVITS Models](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/GPT-SoVITS) and place them in `GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models`.  
2. Download G2PW models from [G2PWModel.zip(HF)](https://huggingface.co/XXXXRT/GPT-SoVITS-Pretrained/resolve/main/G2PWModel.zip)| [G2PWModel.zip(ModelScope)](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/XXXXRT/GPT-SoVITS-Pretrained/resolve/master/G2PWModel.zip), unzip and rename to `G2PWModel`, and then place them in `GPT_SoVITS/text`.(Chinese TTS Only)  
3. For UVR5 (Vocals/Accompaniment Separation & Reverberation Removal, additionally), download models from [UVR5 Weights](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/tree/main/uvr5_weights) and place them in `tools/uvr5/uvr5_weights`.  
- If you want to use `bs_roformer` or `mel_band_roformer` models for UVR5, you can manually download the model and corresponding configuration file, and put them in `tools/uvr5/uvr5_weights`. **Rename the model file and configuration file, ensure that the model and configuration files have the same and corresponding names except for the suffix**. In addition, the model and configuration file names **must include `roformer`** in order to be recognized as models of the roformer class.  
- The suggestion is to **directly specify the model type** in the model name and configuration file name, such as `mel_mand_roformer`, `bs_roformer`. If not specified, the features will be compared from the configuration file to determine which type of model it is. For example, the model `bs_roformer_ep_368_sdr_12.9628.ckpt` and its corresponding configuration file `bs_roformer_ep_368_sdr_12.9628.yaml` are a pair, `kim_mel_band_roformer.ckpt` and `kim_mel_band_roformer.yaml` are also a pair.  
4. For Chinese ASR (additionally), download models from [Damo ASR Model](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/files), [Damo VAD Model](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_fsmn_vad_zh-cn-16k-common-pytorch/files), and [Damo Punc Model](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/punc_ct-transformer_zh-cn-common-vocab272727-pytorch/files) and place them in `tools/asr/models`.  
5. For English or Japanese ASR (additionally), download models from [Faster Whisper Large V3](https://huggingface.co/Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3) and place them in `tools/asr/models`. Also, [other models](https://huggingface.co/Systran) may have the similar effect with smaller disk footprint.
