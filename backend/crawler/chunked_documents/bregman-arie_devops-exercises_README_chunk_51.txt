<summary>What is a memory leak?</summary><br><b>  
A memory leak is a programming error that occurs when a program fails to release memory that is no longer needed, causing the program to consume increasing amounts of memory over time.  
The leaks can lead to a variety of problems, including system crashes, performance degradation, and instability. Usually occurring after failed maintenance on older systems and compatibility with new components over time.
