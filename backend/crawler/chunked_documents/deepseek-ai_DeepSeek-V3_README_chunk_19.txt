[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) v0.6.6 supports DeepSeek-V3 inference for FP8 and BF16 modes on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. Aside from standard techniques, vLLM offers _pipeline parallelism_ allowing you to run this model on multiple machines connected by networks. For detailed guidance, please refer to the [vLLM instructions](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/distributed_serving.html). Please feel free to follow [the enhancement plan](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/11539) as well.
