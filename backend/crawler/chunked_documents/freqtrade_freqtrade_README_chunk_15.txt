Feel like the bot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests!  
Please read the
[Contributing document](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to understand the requirements before sending your pull-requests.  
Coding is not a necessity to contribute - maybe start with improving the documentation?
Issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/labels/good%20first%20issue) can be good first contributions, and will help get you familiar with the codebase.  
**Note** before starting any major new feature work, *please open an issue describing what you are planning to do* or talk to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/p7nuUNVfP7) (please use the #dev channel for this). This will ensure that interested parties can give valuable feedback on the feature, and let others know that you are working on it.  
**Important:** Always create your PR against the `develop` branch, not `stable`.
