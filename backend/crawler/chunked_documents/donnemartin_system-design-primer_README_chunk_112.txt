> Abstraction: graph  
In a graph database, each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes.  Graph databases are optimized to represent complex relationships with many foreign keys or many-to-many relationships.  
Graphs databases offer high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network.  They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources.  Many graphs can only be accessed with [REST APIs](#representational-state-transfer-rest).
