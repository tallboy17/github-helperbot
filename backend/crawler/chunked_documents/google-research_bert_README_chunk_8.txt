Before running this example you must download the
[GLUE data](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) by running
[this script](https://gist.github.com/W4ngatang/60c2bdb54d156a41194446737ce03e2e)
and unpack it to some directory `$GLUE_DIR`. Next, download the `BERT-Base`
checkpoint and unzip it to some directory `$BERT_BASE_DIR`.  
This example code fine-tunes `BERT-Base` on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase
Corpus (MRPC) corpus, which only contains 3,600 examples and can fine-tune in a
few minutes on most GPUs.  
```shell
export BERT_BASE_DIR=/path/to/bert/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12
export GLUE_DIR=/path/to/glue

python run_classifier.py \
--task_name=MRPC \
--do_train=true \
--do_eval=true \
--data_dir=$GLUE_DIR/MRPC \
--vocab_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR/vocab.txt \
--bert_config_file=$BERT_BASE_DIR/bert_config.json \
--init_checkpoint=$BERT_BASE_DIR/bert_model.ckpt \
--max_seq_length=128 \
--train_batch_size=32 \
--learning_rate=2e-5 \
--num_train_epochs=3.0 \
--output_dir=/tmp/mrpc_output/
```  
You should see output like this:  
```
***** Eval results *****
eval_accuracy = 0.845588
eval_loss = 0.505248
global_step = 343
loss = 0.505248
```  
This means that the Dev set accuracy was 84.55%. Small sets like MRPC have a
high variance in the Dev set accuracy, even when starting from the same
pre-training checkpoint. If you re-run multiple times (making sure to point to
different `output_dir`), you should see results between 84% and 88%.  
A few other pre-trained models are implemented off-the-shelf in
`run_classifier.py`, so it should be straightforward to follow those examples to
use BERT for any single-sentence or sentence-pair classification task.  
Note: You might see a message `Running train on CPU`. This really just means
that it's running on something other than a Cloud TPU, which includes a GPU.
