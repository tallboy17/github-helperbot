- "As a medium, books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don’t realize it."
- "In learning sciences, we call this model “transmissionism.” It’s the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another. If only!"
- "By re-testing yourself on material you’ve learned over expanding intervals, you can cheaply and reliably commit huge volumes of information to long-term memory."

- Add images. Our brains are wired visually, so this helps retention.
- Don't add things you don't understand.
- Don't add cards memorizing entire lists.
- Write it out. For wrong answers, I'll write it on paper. The act of writing is meditative. I really enjoy this.

- Build upon the basics
- Stick to the minimum information principle: the material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is

- Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion
- Avoid sets
- Avoid enumerations
- Combat interference - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life
- Personalize and provide examples - personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories
- Provide sources - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance
- Prioritize - effective learning is all about prioritizing.

Richard Feynman's Learning Strategy:  
1. Step 1: Continually ask "Why?”
2. Step 2: When you learn something, learn it to where you can explain it to a child.
3. Step 3: Instead of arbitrarily memorizing things, look for the explanation that makes it obvious.  
> Most people overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in a decade.
> – Bill Gates  
> Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying.
> One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the details/leaves or there is nothing for them to hang on to.
> — Elon Musk  
> "Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it."

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.
> – Benjamin Franklin  
> Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.
> – Socrates  
> That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased.
> – Ralph Waldo Emerson  
> A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.
> – Bruce Lee  
> A lecture has been well described as the process whereby the notes of the teacher become the notes of the student without passing through the mind of either.
> — Mortimer Adler  
> Fools learn from experience. I prefer to learn from the experience of others.
