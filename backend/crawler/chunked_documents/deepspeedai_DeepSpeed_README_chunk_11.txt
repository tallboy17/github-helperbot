DeepSpeed users are diverse and have access to different environments. We recommend to try DeepSpeed on Azure as it is the simplest and easiest method. The recommended method to try DeepSpeed on Azure is through AzureML [recipes](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/v1/python-sdk/workflows/train/deepspeed). The job submission and data preparation scripts have been made available [here](https://github.com/deepspeedai/Megatron-DeepSpeed/tree/main/examples_deepspeed/azureml). For more details on how to use DeepSpeed on Azure, please follow the [Azure tutorial](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/azure/).
