**Diagram as Code**.  
Diagrams lets you draw the cloud system architecture **in Python code**. It was born for **prototyping** a new system architecture design without any design tools. You can also describe or visualize the existing system architecture as well. Diagrams currently supports main major providers including: `AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`, `Kubernetes`, `Alibaba Cloud`, `Oracle Cloud` etc... It also supports `On-Premises` nodes, `SaaS` and major `Programming` frameworks and languages.  
**Diagram as Code** also allows you to **track** the architecture diagram changes in any **version control** system.  
>  NOTE: It does not control any actual cloud resources nor does it generate cloud formation or terraform code. It is just for drawing the cloud system architecture diagrams.
