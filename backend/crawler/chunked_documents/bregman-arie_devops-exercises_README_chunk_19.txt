<summary>What components/projects of OpenStack are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
I’m most familiar with several core OpenStack components:  
- Nova for compute resource provisioning, including VM lifecycle management.
- Neutron for networking, focusing on creating and managing networks, subnets, and routers.
- Cinder for block storage, used to attach and manage storage volumes.
- Keystone for identity services, handling authentication and authorization.  
I’ve implemented these in past projects, configuring them for scalability and security to support multi-tenant environments.
