You can also use Modelers Hub to download models and datasets.  
```bash
export USE_OPENMIND_HUB=1 # `set USE_OPENMIND_HUB=1` for Windows
```  
Train the model by specifying a model ID of the Modelers Hub as the `model_name_or_path`. You can find a full list of model IDs at [Modelers Hub](https://modelers.cn/models), e.g., `TeleAI/TeleChat-7B-pt`.
