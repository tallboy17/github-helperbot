What good is a beautiful demo if you can't share it? Gradio lets you easily share a machine learning demo without having to worry about the hassle of hosting on a web server. Simply set `share=True` in `launch()`, and a publicly accessible URL will be created for your demo. Let's revisit our example demo,  but change the last line as follows:  
```python
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
return "Hello " + name + "!"

demo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="textbox", outputs="textbox")

demo.launch(share=True)  # Share your demo with just 1 extra parameter ðŸš€
```  
When you run this code, a public URL will be generated for your demo in a matter of seconds, something like:  
ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; `https://a23dsf231adb.gradio.live`  
Now, anyone around the world can try your Gradio demo from their browser, while the machine learning model and all computation continues to run locally on your computer.
