- Playbooks ‚Äúreduce stress, the mean time to repair (MTTR), and the risk of human error.‚Äù
- Using a template can be beneficial because starting from a blank document is incredibly hard.
- The Curse of Knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when someone is communicating with others and unknowingly assumes the level of knowledge of the people they are communicating with.
- Make your content easy to glance over.
- If a script is longer than a single line, treat it like code, and check it into a repository to be source control and potentially tested.

Alerting:  
- [My Philosophy On Alerting](https://linuxczar.net/sysadmin/philosophy-on-alerting/)
- Pages should be urgent, important, actionable, and real.
- Err on the side of removing noisy alerts ‚Äì over-monitoring is a harder problem to solve than under-monitoring.
- Symptoms are a better way to capture more problems more comprehensively and robustly with less effort.
- Include cause-based information in symptom-based pages or on dashboards, but avoid alerting directly on causes.
- The further up your serving stack you go, the more distinct problems you catch in a single rule. But don‚Äôt go so far you can‚Äôt sufficiently distinguish what‚Äôs going on.
- If you want a quiet oncall rotation, it‚Äôs imperative to have a system for dealing with things that need timely response, but are not imminently critical.
- This classical article has now become a [chapter](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) in Google's SRE book.
- üèô [The Paradox of Alerts](https://speakerdeck.com/charity/the-paradox-of-alerts): why deleting 90% of your paging alerts can make your systems better, and how to craft an on-call rotation that engineers are happy to join.
