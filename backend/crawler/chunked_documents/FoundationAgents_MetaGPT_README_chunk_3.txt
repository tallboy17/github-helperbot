1. MetaGPT takes a **one line requirement** as input and outputs **user stories / competitive analysis / requirements / data structures / APIs / documents, etc.**
2. Internally, MetaGPT includes **product managers / architects / project managers / engineers.** It provides the entire process of a **software company along with carefully orchestrated SOPs.**
1. `Code = SOP(Team)` is the core philosophy. We materialize SOP and apply it to teams composed of LLMs.
