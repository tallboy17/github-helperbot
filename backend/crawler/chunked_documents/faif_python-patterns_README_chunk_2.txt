Add module level description in form of a docstring with links to corresponding references or other useful information.  
Add "Examples in Python ecosystem" section if you know some. It shows how patterns could be applied to real-world problems.  
[facade.py](patterns/structural/facade.py) has a good example of detailed description,
but sometimes the shorter one as in [template.py](patterns/behavioral/template.py) would suffice.
