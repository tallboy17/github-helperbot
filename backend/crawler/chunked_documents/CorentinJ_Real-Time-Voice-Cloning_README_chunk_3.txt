Like everything else in Deep Learning, this repo has quickly gotten old. Many SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository will. If you wish for an open-source solution with a high voice quality:
- Check out [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/task/speech-synthesis/) for other repositories and recent research in the field of speech synthesis.
- Check out [Chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) for a similar project up to date with the 2025 SOTA in voice cloning
