FastChat provides OpenAI-compatible APIs for its supported models, so you can use FastChat as a local drop-in replacement for OpenAI APIs.
The FastChat server is compatible with both [openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) library and cURL commands.
The REST API is capable of being executed from Google Colab free tier, as demonstrated in the [FastChat_API_GoogleColab.ipynb](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/playground/FastChat_API_GoogleColab.ipynb) notebook, available in our repository.
See [docs/openai_api.md](docs/openai_api.md).
