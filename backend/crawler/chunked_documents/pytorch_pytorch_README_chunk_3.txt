If you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).  
![Tensor illustration](./docs/source/_static/img/tensor_illustration.png)  
PyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the
computation by a huge amount.  
We provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs
such as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.
And they are fast!
