Manus is incredible, but OpenManus can achieve any idea without an *Invite Code* ðŸ›«!  
Our team members [@Xinbin Liang](https://github.com/mannaandpoem) and [@Jinyu Xiang](https://github.com/XiangJinyu) (core authors), along with [@Zhaoyang Yu](https://github.com/MoshiQAQ), [@Jiayi Zhang](https://github.com/didiforgithub), and [@Sirui Hong](https://github.com/stellaHSR), we are from [@MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT). The prototype is launched within 3 hours and we are keeping building!  
It's a simple implementation, so we welcome any suggestions, contributions, and feedback!  
Enjoy your own agent with OpenManus!  
We're also excited to introduce [OpenManus-RL](https://github.com/OpenManus/OpenManus-RL), an open-source project dedicated to reinforcement learning (RL)- based (such as GRPO) tuning methods for LLM agents, developed collaboratively by researchers from UIUC and OpenManus.
