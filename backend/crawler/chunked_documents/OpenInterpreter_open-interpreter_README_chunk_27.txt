Open Interpreter equips a [function-calling language model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) with an `exec()` function, which accepts a `language` (like "Python" or "JavaScript") and `code` to run.  
We then stream the model's messages, code, and your system's outputs to the terminal as Markdown.
