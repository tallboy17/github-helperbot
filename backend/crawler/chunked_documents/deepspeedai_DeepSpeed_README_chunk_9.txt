The [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/deepspeedai/deepspeed) library (this repository) implements and packages the innovations and technologies in DeepSpeed Training, Inference and Compression Pillars into a single easy-to-use, open-sourced repository. It allows for easy composition of multitude of features within a single training, inference or compression pipeline. The DeepSpeed Library is heavily adopted by the DL community, and has been used to enable some of the most powerful models (see [DeepSpeed Adoption](#deepspeed-adoption)).
