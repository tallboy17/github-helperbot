<summary>What is a data node?</summary><br><b>  
This is where data is stored and also where different processing takes place (e.g. when you search for a data).
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is a master node?</summary><br><b>  
Part of a master node responsibilities:
* Track the status of all the nodes in the cluster
* Verify replicas are working and the data is available from every data node.
* No hot nodes (no data node that works much harder than other nodes)  
While there can be multiple master nodes in reality only of them is the elected master node.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is an ingest node?</summary><br><b>  
A node which responsible for processing the data according to ingest pipeline. In case you don't need to use
logstash then this node can receive data from beats and process it, similarly to how it can be processed
in Logstash.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is Coordinating only node?</summary><br><b>  
From the official docs:  
Coordinating only nodes can benefit large clusters by offloading the coordinating node role from data and master-eligible nodes. They join the cluster and receive the full cluster state, like every other node, and they use the cluster state to route requests directly to the appropriate place(s).  
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>How data is stored in Elasticsearch?</summary><br><b>  
* Data is stored in an index
* The index is spread across the cluster using shards
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is an Index?</summary><br><b>  
Index in Elasticsearch is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br>
You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).  
The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):  
"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data"
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>Explain Shards</summary><br><b>  
An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.<br>
This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is an Inverted Index?</summary><br><b>  
From the official docs:  
"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in."
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is a Document?</summary><br><b>  
Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elasticsearch is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL.
As in NoSQL a document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>You check the health of your elasticsearch cluster and it's red. What does it mean? What can cause the status to be yellow instead of green?</summary><br><b>  
Red means some data is unavailable in your cluster. Some shards of your indices are unassigned.
There are some other states for the cluster.
Yellow means that you have unassigned shards in the cluster. You can be in this state if you have single node and your indices have replicas.
Green means that all shards in the cluster are assigned to nodes and your cluster is healthy.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability</summary><br><b>  
False.
From the official docs:  
"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees."
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What reserved fields a document has?</summary><br><b>  
* _index
* _id
* _type
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>Explain Mapping</summary><br><b>
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)</summary><br><b>  
* You can optimize fields for partial matching
* You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)
* You can perform language-specific analysis
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>Explain Replicas</summary><br><b>  
In a network/cloud environment where failures can be expected any time, it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason.
To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your indexâ€™s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>Can you explain Term Frequency & Document Frequency?</summary><br><b>  
Term Frequency is how often a term appears in a given document and Document Frequency is how often a term appears in all documents. They both are used for determining the relevance of a term by calculating Term Frequency / Document Frequency.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>You check "Current Phase" under "Index lifecycle management" and you see it's set to "hot". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>  
"The index is actively being written to".
More about the phases [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ilm-policy-definition.html)

<summary>What this command does? <code>curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/1?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{ "name": "John Doe" }'</code></summary><br><b>  
It creates customer index if it doesn't exists and adds a new document with the field name which is set to "John Dow". Also, if it's the first document it will get the ID 1.
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What will happen if you run the previous command twice? What about running it 100 times?</code></summary><br><b>  
1. If name value was different then it would update "name" to the new value
2. In any case, it bumps version field by one
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is the Bulk API? What would you use it for?</code></summary><br><b>  
Bulk API is used when you need to index multiple documents. For high number of documents it would be significantly faster to use rather than individual requests since there are less network roundtrips.
