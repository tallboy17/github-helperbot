The cheat.sh service has its own command line client (`cht.sh`) that
has several useful features compared to querying the service directly with `curl`:  
* Special shell mode with a persistent queries context and readline support.
* Queries history.
* Clipboard integration.
* Tab completion support for shells (bash, fish, zsh).
* Stealth mode.
