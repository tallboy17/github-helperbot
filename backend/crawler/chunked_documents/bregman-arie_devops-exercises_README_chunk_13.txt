<summary>What are some characteristics of the Go programming language?</summary><br><b>  
* Strong and static typing - the type of the variables can't be changed over time and they have to be defined at compile time
* Simplicity
* Fast compile times
* Built-in concurrency
* Garbage collected
* Platform independent
* Compile to standalone binary - anything you need to run your app will be compiled into one binary. Very useful for version management in run-time.  
Go also has good community.

<summary>What is the difference between <code>var x int = 2</code> and <code>x := 2</code>?</summary><br><b>  
The result is the same, a variable with the value 2.  
With <code>var x int = 2</code> we are setting the variable type to integer while with <code>x := 2</code> we are letting Go figure out by itself the type.

<summary>True or False? In Go we can redeclare variables and once declared we must use it.</summary>  
False. We can't redeclare variables but yes, we must used declared variables.

<summary>What libraries of Go have you used?</summary><br><b>  
This should be answered based on your usage but some examples are:  
* fmt - formatted I/O

<summary>What is the problem with the following block of code? How to fix it?  
```
func main() {
var x float32 = 13.5
var y int
y = x
}
```

<summary>The following block of code tries to convert the integer 101 to a string but instead we get "e". Why is that? How to fix it?  
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
var x int = 101
var y string
y = string(x)
fmt.Println(y)
}
```
</summary><br><b>  
It looks what unicode value is set at 101 and uses it for converting the integer to a string.
If you want to get "101" you should use the package "strconv" and replace <code>y = string(x)</code> with <code>y = strconv.Itoa(x)</code>

<summary>What is wrong with the following code?:  
```
package main

func main() {
var x = 2
var y = 3
const someConst = x + y
}
```
</summary><br><b>  
Constants in Go can only be declared using constant expressions.
But `x`, `y` and their sum is variable.
<br>
<code>const initializer x + y is not a constant</code>

<summary>What will be the output of the following block of code?:  
```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
x = iota
y = iota
)
const z = iota

func main() {
fmt.Printf("%v\n", x)
fmt.Printf("%v\n", y)
fmt.Printf("%v\n", z)
}
```
</summary><br><b>  
Go's iota identifier is used in const declarations to simplify definitions of incrementing numbers. Because it can be used in expressions, it provides a generality beyond that of simple enumerations.
<br>
`x` and `y` in the first iota group, `z` in the second.

<summary>What _ is used for in Go?</summary><br><b>  
It avoids having to declare all the variables for the returns values.
It is called the [blank identifier](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#blank).

2 [1 2 3 4]<br>
</code>  
In `mod1` a is link, and when we're using `a[i]`, we're changing `s1` value to.
But in `mod2`, `append` creates new slice, and we're changing only `a` value, not `s2`.
