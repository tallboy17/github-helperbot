* The face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work very well on children. It tends to mix
up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.
* Accuracy may vary between ethnic groups. Please see [this wiki page](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/wiki/Face-Recognition-Accuracy-Problems#question-face-recognition-works-well-with-european-individuals-but-overall-accuracy-is-lower-with-asian-individuals) for more details.
