You can access cheat.sh from Windows command line too.  
Use cheat.sh command line client for that: [`cht.exe`](https://github.com/tpanj/cht.exe).
It supports:  
* output colorization;
* command line options;
* its own configuration file.  
You can also use [`scoop`](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) command-line installer for Windows to get it:
```batch
scoop install cht
```
