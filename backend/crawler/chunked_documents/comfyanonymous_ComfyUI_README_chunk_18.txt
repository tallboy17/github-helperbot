Nvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:  
```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128```  
This is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.  
```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128```
