To search for a keyword, use the query:  
```
/~keyword
```  
In this case search is not recursive â€” it is conducted only in a page of the specified level.
For example:  
```
/~snapshot          look for snapshot in the first level cheat sheets
/scala/~currying     look for currying in scala cheat sheets
```  
For a recursive search in all cheat sheets, use double slash:  
```
/~snapshot/r         look for snapshot in all cheat sheets
```  
You can use special search options after the closing slash:  
```
/~shot/bi           case insensitive (i), word boundaries (b)
```  
List of search options:  
```
i   case insensitive search
b   word boundaries
r   recursive search
```
