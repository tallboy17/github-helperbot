- [OO vs FP](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html), Robert C. Martin, The Clean Code Blog. A pretty interesting take on the differences between OOP and FP from an expert in OOP.
- OO is not about state. Objects are bags of functions, not bags of data.
- Functional Programs, like OO Programs, are composed of functions that operate on data.
- FP imposes discipline upon assignment.
- OO imposes discipline on function pointers.
- The principles of software design still apply, regardless of your programming style. The fact that you‚Äôve decided to use a language that doesn‚Äôt have an assignment operator does not mean that you can ignore the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [Parse, don‚Äôt validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
- Use a data structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable
- Push the burden of proof upward as far as possible, but no further
- Let your datatypes inform your code, don‚Äôt let your code control your datatypes
- Don‚Äôt be afraid to parse data in multiple passes
- Avoid denormalized representations of data, especially if it‚Äôs mutable
- Use abstract datatypes to make validators ‚Äúlook like‚Äù parsers
