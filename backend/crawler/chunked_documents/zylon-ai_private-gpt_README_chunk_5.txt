PrivateGPT is now evolving towards becoming a gateway to generative AI models and primitives, including
completions, document ingestion, RAG pipelines and other low-level building blocks.
We want to make it easier for any developer to build AI applications and experiences, as well as provide
a suitable extensive architecture for the community to keep contributing.  
Stay tuned to our [releases](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt/releases) to check out all the new features and changes included.
