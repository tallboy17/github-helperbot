- [Tips on naming boolean variables](https://dev.to/michi/tips-on-naming-boolean-variables-cleaner-code-35ig)
- There is a convention to prefix boolean variables and function names with "is" or "has".
- Try to always use is, even for plurals (`isEachUserLoggedIn` is better than `areUsersLoggedIn` or `isUsersLoggedIn`)
- Avoid custom prefixes (`isPaidFor` is better than `wasPaidFor`)
- Avoid negatives (`isEnabled` is better than `isDisabled`)
