We are unlocking the power of large language models. Llama 2 is now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers, and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate, and scale their ideas responsibly.  
This release includes model weights and starting code for pre-trained and fine-tuned Llama language models â€” ranging from 7B to 70B parameters.  
This repository is intended as a minimal example to load [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) models and run inference.
