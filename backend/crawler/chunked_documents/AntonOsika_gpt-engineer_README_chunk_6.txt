- gpt-engineer installs the binary 'bench', which gives you a simple interface for benchmarking your own agent implementations against popular public datasets.
- The easiest way to get started with benchmarking is by checking out the [template](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpte-bench-template) repo, which contains detailed instructions and an agent template.
- Currently supported benchmark:
- [APPS](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps)
- [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp)  
The community has started work with different benchmarking initiatives, as described in [this Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/206805143fbb4302b5455a5329eaab17?sid=f689608f-8e49-44f7-b55f-4c81e9dc93e6) video.
