>If you are a newcomer to the Deep Learning area, the first question you may have is "Which paper should I start reading from?"  
>Here is a reading roadmap of Deep Learning papers!  
The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:  
- From outline to detail
- From old to state-of-the-art
- from generic to specific areas
- focus on state-of-the-art  
You will find many papers that are quite new but really worth reading.  
I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.
