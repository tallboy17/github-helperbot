| `release3`         | openpilot.comma.ai                      | This is openpilot's release branch.                                                 |
| `release3-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`          | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`      | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |
| `secretgoodopenpilot` | installer.comma.ai/commaai/secretgoodopenpilot | This is a preview branch from the autonomy team where new driving models get merged earlier than master. |

Safety and Testing
----  
* openpilot observes [ISO26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262) guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software-in-the-loop [tests](.github/workflows/selfdrive_tests.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software-in-the-loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware-in-the-loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware-in-the-loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.  
openpilot logs the road-facing cameras, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver-facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.
