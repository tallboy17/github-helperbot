If you want to edit a cheat.sh cheat sheet, you should edit it in the upstream repository.
You will find the name of the source repository in a browser when you open a cheat sheet.
There are two github buttons at the bottom of the page: the second one is the button
of the repository, which belongs the current cheat sheet.  
You can edit the cheat sheet directly in your browser (you need a github account for it).
There is an edit button in the top right corner. If you click on it, an editor will be open.
There you will change the cheat sheet (under the hood: the upstream repository is forked, your changes are
committed in the forked repository, a pull request to the upstream repository owner is sent).
