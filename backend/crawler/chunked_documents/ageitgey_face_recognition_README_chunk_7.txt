First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:  
* [How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf)  
Then, make sure you have cmake installed:  
```brew install cmake```  
Finally, install this module from pypi using `pip3` (or `pip2` for Python 2):  
```bash
pip3 install face_recognition
```  
Alternatively, you can try this library with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), see [this section](#deployment).  
If you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out a
[pre-configured VM](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b).
