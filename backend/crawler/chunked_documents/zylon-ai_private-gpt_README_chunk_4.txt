The first version of PrivateGPT was launched in May 2023 as a novel approach to address the privacy
concerns by using LLMs in a complete offline way.  
That version, which rapidly became a go-to project for privacy-sensitive setups and served as the seed
for thousands of local-focused generative AI projects, was the foundation of what PrivateGPT is becoming nowadays;
thus a simpler and more educational implementation to understand the basic concepts required
to build a fully local -and therefore, private- chatGPT-like tool.  
If you want to keep experimenting with it, we have saved it in the
[primordial branch](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt/tree/primordial) of the project.  
> It is strongly recommended to do a clean clone and install of this new version of
PrivateGPT if you come from the previous, primordial version.
