- Chatbot Arena has collected over 1.5M human votes from side-by-side LLM battles to compile an online [LLM Elo leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard).  
FastChat's core features include:
- The training and evaluation code for state-of-the-art models (e.g., Vicuna, MT-Bench).
- A distributed multi-model serving system with web UI and OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs.
