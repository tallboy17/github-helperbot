<summary>Explain what is an API</summary><br><b>  
I like this definition from [blog.christianposta.com](https://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/api-gateways-are-going-through-an-identity-crisis):  
"An explicitly and purposefully defined interface designed to be invoked over a network that enables software developers to get programmatic access to data and functionality within an organization in a controlled and comfortable way."
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>What is an API specification?</summary><br><b>  
From [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/difference-between-api-documentation-specification):  
"An API specification provides a broad understanding of how an API behaves and how the API links with other APIs. It explains how the API functions and the results to expect when using the API"
</b></details>  
<details>
<summary>True or False? API Definition is the same as API Specification</summary><br><b>  
False. From [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/difference-between-api-documentation-specification):  
"An API definition is similar to an API specification in that it provides an understanding of how an API is organized and how the API functions. But the API definition is aimed at machine consumption instead of human consumption of APIs."

<summary>What is an API gateway?</summary><br><b>  
An API gateway is like the gatekeeper that controls how different parts talk to each other and how information is exchanged between them.  
The API gateway provides a single point of entry for all clients, and it can perform several tasks, including routing requests to the appropriate backend service, load balancing, security and authentication, rate limiting, caching, and monitoring.  
By using an API gateway, organizations can simplify the management of their APIs, ensure consistent security and governance, and improve the performance and scalability of their backend services. They are also commonly used in microservices architectures, where there are many small, independent services that need to be accessed by different clients.

<summary>What are the advantages of using/implementing an API gateway?</summary><br><b>  
Advantages:  
- Simplifies API management: Provides a single entry point for all requests, which simplifies the management and monitoring of multiple APIs.
- Improves security: Able to implement security features like authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect the backend services from unauthorized access.
- Enhances scalability: Can handle traffic spikes and distribute requests to backend services in a way that maximizes resource utilization and improves overall system performance.
- Enables service composition: Can combine different backend services into a single API, providing more granular control over the services that clients can access.
- Facilitates integration with external systems:  Can be used to expose internal services to external partners or customers, making it easier to integrate with external systems and enabling new business models.
