[LightLLM](https://github.com/ModelTC/lightllm/tree/main) v1.0.1 supports single-machine and multi-machine tensor parallel deployment for DeepSeek-R1 (FP8/BF16) and provides mixed-precision deployment, with more quantization modes continuously integrated. For more details, please refer to [LightLLM instructions](https://lightllm-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html). Additionally, LightLLM offers PD-disaggregation deployment for DeepSeek-V2, and the implementation of PD-disaggregation for DeepSeek-V3 is in development.
