- **I'm running into an error when setting up the backend. How can I fix it?** [Try this](https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code/issues/3#issuecomment-1814777959). If that still doesn't work, open an issue.
- **How do I get an OpenAI API key?** See https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md
- **How can I configure an OpenAI proxy?** - If you're not able to access the OpenAI API directly (due to e.g. country restrictions), you can try a VPN or you can configure the OpenAI base URL to use a proxy: Set OPENAI_BASE_URL in the `backend/.env` or directly in the UI in the settings dialog. Make sure the URL has "v1" in the path so it should look like this: `https://xxx.xxxxx.xxx/v1`
- **How can I update the backend host that my front-end connects to?** - Configure VITE_HTTP_BACKEND_URL and VITE_WS_BACKEND_URL in front/.env.local For example, set VITE_HTTP_BACKEND_URL=http://124.10.20.1:7001
- **Seeing UTF-8 errors when running the backend?** - On windows, open the .env file with notepad++, then go to Encoding and select UTF-8.
- **How can I provide feedback?** For feedback, feature requests and bug reports, open an issue or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_abi_).
