We use pre-releases to:
- Test new features in real-world scenarios
- Gather feedback before final releases
- Ensure stability for production users
- Allow early adopters to try new features  
For production environments, we recommend using the stable version. For testing new features, you can opt-in to pre-releases using the `--pre` flag.
