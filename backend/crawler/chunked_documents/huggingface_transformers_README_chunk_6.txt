Transformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models, it's a community of projects built around it and the
Hugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone
else to build their dream projects.  
In order to celebrate Transformers 100,000 stars, we wanted to put the spotlight on the
community with the [awesome-transformers](./awesome-transformers.md) page which lists 100
incredible projects built with Transformers.  
If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it!
