- Text2Spec models (Tacotron, Tacotron2, Glow-TTS, SpeedySpeech).
- Speaker Encoder to compute speaker embeddings efficiently.
- Vocoder models (MelGAN, Multiband-MelGAN, GAN-TTS, ParallelWaveGAN, WaveGrad, WaveRNN)
- Fast and efficient model training.
- Detailed training logs on the terminal and Tensorboard.
- Support for Multi-speaker TTS.
- Efficient, flexible, lightweight but feature complete `Trainer API`.
- Released and ready-to-use models.
- Tools to curate Text2Speech datasets under```dataset_analysis```.
- Utilities to use and test your models.
- Modular (but not too much) code base enabling easy implementation of new ideas.
