I've found these books incredibly inspiring:  
- ðŸ“– [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/): hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.
- ðŸ“– [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670): a nice addition to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
- ðŸ“– [Release It!](https://smile.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395): this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.
- ðŸ“– [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web Sites](https://smile.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/013443160X)
- ðŸ“– [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200): outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces.
- ðŸ“– [Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) (free): One of the most influential textbooks in Computer Science (written and used at MIT), SICP has been influential in CS education. [Byte](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)>) recommended SICP "for professional programmers who are really interested in their profession".  
There are some free books available, including:  
- ðŸ“– [Professional software development](http://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/): pretty complete and a good companion to this page. The free chapters are mostly focused on software development processes: design, testing, code writing, etc. - and not so much about tech itself.
