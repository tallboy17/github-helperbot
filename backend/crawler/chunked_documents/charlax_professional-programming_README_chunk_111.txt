Books:  
- üìñ [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/)
- Written by members of Google's SRE team, with a comprehensive analysis of the entire software lifecycle - how to build, deploy, monitor, and maintain large scale systems.  
Quotes:

Articles:  
- I already mentioned the book Release it! above. There's also a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/justindorfman/stability-patterns-presentation) from the author.
- [Service Recovery: Rolling Back vs. Forward Fixing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/service-recovery-rolling-back-vs-forward-fixing-mohamed-el-geish/)
- [How Complex Systems Fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail/)
- Catastrophe requires multiple failures ‚Äì single point failures are not enough.
- Complex systems contain changing mixtures of failures latent within them.
- Post-accident attribution to a ‚Äòroot cause‚Äô is fundamentally wrong.
- Hindsight biases post-accident assessments of human performance.
- Safety is a characteristic of systems and not of their components
- Failure free operations require experience with failure.
- [Systems that defy detailed understanding](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/systems-that-defy-understanding/)
- Focus effort on systems-level failure, instead of the individual component failure.
- Invest in sophisticated observability tools, aiming to increase the number of questions we can ask without deploying custom code
- [Operating a Large, Distributed System in a Reliable Way: Practices I Learned](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/operating-a-high-scale-distributed-system/), Gergely Orosz.
- A good summary of processes to implement.
- [Production Oriented Development](https://paulosman.me/2019/12/30/production-oriented-development.html)
- Code in production is the only code that matters
- Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be responsible for operating it in production.
- Buy Almost Always Beats Build
- Make Deploys Easy
- Trust the People Closest to the Knives
- QA Gates Make Quality Worse
- Boring Technology is Great.
- Non-Production Environments Have Diminishing Returns
- Things Will Always Break
- üèô [High Reliability Infrastructure migrations](https://speakerdeck.com/jvns/high-reliability-infrastructure-migrations), Julia Evans.
- [Appendix F: Personal Observations on the Reliability of the Shuttle](https://www.refsmmat.com/files/reflections.pdf), Richard Feynman
- [Lessons learned from two decades of Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/resources/practices-and-processes/twenty-years-of-sre-lessons-learned/)
