Early versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its
initial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and
there were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,
_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.
