- Software engineering isn’t just coding. Actually, coding is a small part of it.
- Pipeline your work
- Be open to feedback and listen. Like, seriously, listen.
- Great feedback is hard to find; treasure it.
- Keep an eye on the horizon (but not both).
- Figure out what matters and let the rest go.
- Comparison really is the thief of joy.
- Mentorship is a beautiful thing.
- Good days, in general, don’t just “happen”.
- Advice and guidance are just that; they aren’t rules.
