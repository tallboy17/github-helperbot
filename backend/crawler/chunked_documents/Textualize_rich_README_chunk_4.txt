To effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the [rich print](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#quick-start) method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function. Try this:  
```python
from rich import print

print("Hello, [bold magenta]World[/bold magenta]!", ":vampire:", locals())
```
