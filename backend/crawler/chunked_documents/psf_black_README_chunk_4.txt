_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in
place. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't
take previous formatting into account (see
[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)
for exceptions).  
Our documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are
also documented. They're both worth taking a look at:  
- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)
- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)  
Changes to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:
