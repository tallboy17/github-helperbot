Currently, the easiest way to get a self-hosted instance running is by using
the `docker-compose.yml` file.  
docker-compose up  
This builds and runs the image with baked in cheatsheets and starts the app
and a Redis instance to back it, making the service available at
http://localhost:8002 This is currently an early implementation and should
probably not be used for anything outside of internal/dev/personal use right
now.
