* RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.
* A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.
* It can be difficult to debug RPC.
* You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box.  For example, it might require additional effort to ensure [RPC calls are properly cached](https://web.archive.org/web/20170608193645/http://etherealbits.com/2012/12/debunking-the-myths-of-rpc-rest/) on caching servers such as [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/).
