There is no official Chainer implementation. However, Sosuke Kobayashi made a
[Chainer version of BERT available](https://github.com/soskek/bert-chainer)
which is compatible with our pre-trained checkpoints and is able to reproduce
our results. We were not involved in the creation or maintenance of the Chainer
implementation so please direct any questions towards the authors of that
repository.
