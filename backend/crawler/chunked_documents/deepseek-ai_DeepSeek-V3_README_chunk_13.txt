First, clone our DeepSeek-V3 GitHub repository:  
```shell
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.git
```  
Navigate to the `inference` folder and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Easiest way is to use a package manager like `conda` or `uv` to create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies.  
```shell
cd DeepSeek-V3/inference
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
Download the model weights from Hugging Face, and put them into `/path/to/DeepSeek-V3` folder.
