Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles
configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning,
ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex
changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on the Ansible [website](https://ansible.com/).
