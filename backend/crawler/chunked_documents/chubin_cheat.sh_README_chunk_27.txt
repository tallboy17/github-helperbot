You don't need to install anything, to start using *cheat.sh*.  
There are two cases, when you want to install *cheat.sh* locally:  
1. You plan to use it off-line, without Internet access;
2. You want to use your own cheat sheets (additionally, or as a replacement).  
Installation process in described in details here: [cheat.sh standalone installation](doc/standalone.md)
